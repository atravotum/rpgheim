2.) Talents
	Blacksmithing:
		* Allows you to craft better armor/weapons/items
		* Levels up as you craft stuff and smelt/mine ore
	Gathering:
		* Increases the yields from gathering plants/resources in the world (does not apply to mineral nodes)
		* Levels up as you gather things like blueberries, raspberries, thistles, dandelion, etc
	Cooking:
		* Allows you to cook better food items and use high level ingreadients
		* Levels up by crafting (cooking) food items
	Find Hidden:
		* Allows the player to be notified of hidden items (same as wishbone, but a talent now)
		* Levels up by finding hidden items

3.) Enemy Scaling
	- Custom enemy stat scaling like health, damage, element types, etc to make for a more difficulty slower but consistent difficulty 	curve to account for all the new features.

4.) Armor Re-Work
	- Armor system needs to be reworked to fit into the class sytems (Fighter/Healer can wear heavy, Mage/Rogue can wear light), stats 	and what not also will likely need to be tweaked for good balance

5.) World Tiers
	- Offer world tiers that increases game difficulty in a variety of ways (enemy scaling, new enemy abilities, new enemies, etc). 	Should reuse all items with new names/stats. Think Diablo new game items.

6.) Epic Look Expansions
	- Add new stats/abilities to items, tweak current stat ranges to ensure balance with mod.

7.) Better Trader Configurations/Expansions
	- Add any new items to trader config if needed, tweak prices and everything for a balanced experience
	- Server market/economy? (not prototype, future facing idea maybe)

8.) Valheim Plus Configurations
	- Probably just turn off any features that might conflict, otherwise most settings shouldn't matter.

9.) UI/Hud Expansions
	- New sections for ability icons?

10.) New Content
	-New Weapons, Armor, Food, Resources, Stations, Class Books, Enemies, Effects, Abilities, Etc.
